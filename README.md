## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- CSS Flexbox

### Continued development

I still want to pracitce with flexbox. I think I did a good job with this project as it was simple enough to set up the layout with flexbox. Also allowing for more responsiveness when resizing the screen is something I can continue to work on. Media queries are a little confusing to me, but I am still working on them
